## Overview
The Cloud Enablement effort, existing as a part of the Data Ingestion Building Blocks (DIBBs) triad, aims to enable rapid cloud conversion of existing OPHDST systems, while promoting rapid onboarding of new projects to the CDC External Azure Environment (CDCExt). We offer teams the ability to leverage space within our unified multi-tenant Azure kubernetes cluster for simple workloads, while granting teams the freedom to leverage our tools and guidance to deploy their own custom solutions.
