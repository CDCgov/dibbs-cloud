# Foundations Intro
The **Foundations** section of the Self-Service Portal contains the foundational building blocks of your Azure environment. These resources are required to create the basics of a functional environment and are used by other resources in the environment. Without these components, you will be unable to Terraform the rest of your infrastructure. The following resources are available in the Foundations section:
